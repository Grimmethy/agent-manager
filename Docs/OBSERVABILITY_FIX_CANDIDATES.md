# Observability Fix Candidates

### AC-1 · Silent cache-write failure in budget-monitor health check
Strength: Strong
Files: budget-monitor.js

Problem:
The catch block that guards the best-effort cache write (to `CACHE_PATH`) contains no log, metric, or counter of any kind. If the parent directory becomes unwritable due to permissions drift, an NFS mount dropping, or disk filling, every subsequent health-check cycle will silently skip caching with zero operator-visible signal. The failure is persistent and invisible: no log line to grep, no alert to page on, no metric delta to chart. The `catch {` (no binding) syntax confirms the omission is deliberate in control-flow intent (a cache-write hiccup must not flip the health check to unhealthy), but the author conflated "swallow the error" with "emit zero signal."

Solution:
Replace the empty catch body with a single `console.warn` (or `log.warn` if the project uses a structured logger) that includes the error message and the target path, while preserving the existing control flow so the health check still reports healthy. For example: `} catch (err) { console.warn('[budget-monitor] cache write failed (non-fatal): ' + err.message); }`. Optionally, if a metrics library is available, increment a counter such as `budget_monitor.cache_write_failures` on the same line. No rethrow, no change to the health-check return value.

Benefits:
Operators gain a greppable, alertable signal the moment the first cache write fails, turning a silent persistent degradation into a one-line log entry that can be routed to alerting. The happy path is unaffected because the branch is never entered when the write succeeds. The fix costs zero runtime overhead on the normal path and preserves the correct design decision that a transient I/O hiccup must not produce a false-positive unhealthy signal.

### AC-2 · Bare catch in budget-monitor readdir swallows non-ENOENT errors silently
Strength: Strong
Files: budget-monitor.js

Problem:
The directory-scan loop in `budget-monitor.js` wraps `fs.readdirSync(dir, { withFileTypes: true })` in a bare `catch { return out; }` with no error binding, no errno inspection, no log line, and no comment. This means that if the OS returns `EACCES` (permissions revoked mid-run), `EIO` (NFS/filesystem hiccup), or `ENOTDIR` (a config path pointing at a file), the function silently returns a shorter-than-expected entry list and the caller proceeds as though every budget record was read. In a long-running agent-manager process there is no `console.warn`, no structured log, no `process.emitWarning`, and no rethrow—so the operator has zero signal that a directory of budget entries was skipped, and the monitor will report "all clear" while actually missing records.

Solution:
Replace the bare `catch { return out; }` with a bound catch that inspects `err.code` and branches: if `err.code === 'ENOENT'`, return `out` unchanged (the directory is genuinely optional and may not exist yet during startup); for every other code (`EACCES`, `EIO`, `ENOTDIR`, etc.), emit `console.warn(\`[budget-monitor] readdirSync(${dir}) failed: ${err.code} – returning partial results (${out.length} entries)\`)` before returning `out`. Concretely, the block becomes: `let entries; try { entries = fs.readdirSync(dir, { withFileTypes: true }); } catch (err) { if (err.code === 'ENOENT') { return out; } console.warn(\`[budget-monitor] readdirSync(${dir}) failed: ${err.code} – returning partial results (${out.length} entries)\`); return out; }` followed by the existing loop over `entries`. If the project already imports a structured logger (pino, winston, bunyan), swap the `console.warn` call for `logger.warn({ dir, err: err.code, partial: out.length }, 'budget-monitor: readdirSync failed, returning partial results')` to keep the message in the same structured-log stream as the rest of the service.

Benefits:
Once the errno-aware branch is in place, the single expected case (directory not yet created) remains a silent no-op, while every unexpected failure produces a timestamped, greppable warning line that names the directory, the errno, and how many entries were actually collected. An operator tailing logs or a monitoring pipeline scraping warn-level output will immediately see that a budget directory was unreadable, can correlate the missing entries with the `EACCES`/`EIO` event, and remediate (fix permissions, restart the NFS mount, correct the path) instead of discovering the gap only when a budget line is unexpectedly absent from a report. The change is two lines of logic inside an existing catch block, introduces no new dependencies, and does not alter the function's return contract—callers still receive a (possibly partial) array—so no downstream code needs to change.
