# Observability Fix Candidates

### AC-1 · Silent cache-write failure in budget-monitor health check
Strength: Strong
Files: budget-monitor.js

Problem:
The catch block that guards the best-effort cache write (to `CACHE_PATH`) contains no log, metric, or counter of any kind. If the parent directory becomes unwritable due to permissions drift, an NFS mount dropping, or disk filling, every subsequent health-check cycle will silently skip caching with zero operator-visible signal. The failure is persistent and invisible: no log line to grep, no alert to page on, no metric delta to chart. The `catch {` (no binding) syntax confirms the omission is deliberate in control-flow intent (a cache-write hiccup must not flip the health check to unhealthy), but the author conflated "swallow the error" with "emit zero signal."

Solution:
Replace the empty catch body with a single `console.warn` (or `log.warn` if the project uses a structured logger) that includes the error message and the target path, while preserving the existing control flow so the health check still reports healthy. For example: `} catch (err) { console.warn('[budget-monitor] cache write failed (non-fatal): ' + err.message); }`. Optionally, if a metrics library is available, increment a counter such as `budget_monitor.cache_write_failures` on the same line. No rethrow, no change to the health-check return value.

Benefits:
Operators gain a greppable, alertable signal the moment the first cache write fails, turning a silent persistent degradation into a one-line log entry that can be routed to alerting. The happy path is unaffected because the branch is never entered when the write succeeds. The fix costs zero runtime overhead on the normal path and preserves the correct design decision that a transient I/O hiccup must not produce a false-positive unhealthy signal.

### AC-2 · Add diagnostic log to silent catch in structcheck coverage reader
Strength: Strong
Files: src/arch-discovery-structcheck.js

Problem:
At line 77 the `catch` block around the `fs.readFileSync` / `JSON.parse` of `communityCoveragePath` swallows the error entirely — no `console.warn`, no `process.emitWarning`, no rethrow, no structured error field on the return object. If the file exists but is corrupt, or the path is misconfigured, the operator sees the same `{ exhausted: false, failCount: 0 }` response as when the file is simply absent, making it impossible to distinguish "upstream step never ran" from "upstream step produced garbage." In a CI or service context this means a silently broken coverage pipeline can persist indefinitely with zero signal.

Solution:
Inside the existing `catch` block, add a single `console.warn` call that includes the resolved path and the error message, e.g. `console.warn(\`[structcheck] failed to read community coverage at ${communityCoveragePath}: ${err.message}\`)`. Keep the existing `return { exhausted: false, failCount: 0 }` unchanged so the graceful-degradation contract is preserved; the log is purely additive observability and does not alter control flow or the return shape.

Benefits:
Operators and CI logs now receive a one-line diagnostic the moment the coverage file is unreadable or malformed, eliminating the ambiguity between "file not yet produced" and "file corrupted." No behavioral change, no new dependency, no risk to callers — the fix is a single statement that converts a silent failure into a visible, greppable warning while preserving the existing best-effort semantics.
