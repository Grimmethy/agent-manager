# Observability Fix Candidates

### AC-1 · Silent cache-write failure in budget-monitor health check
Strength: Strong
Files: budget-monitor.js

Problem:
The catch block that guards the best-effort cache write (to `CACHE_PATH`) contains no log, metric, or counter of any kind. If the parent directory becomes unwritable due to permissions drift, an NFS mount dropping, or disk filling, every subsequent health-check cycle will silently skip caching with zero operator-visible signal. The failure is persistent and invisible: no log line to grep, no alert to page on, no metric delta to chart. The `catch {` (no binding) syntax confirms the omission is deliberate in control-flow intent (a cache-write hiccup must not flip the health check to unhealthy), but the author conflated "swallow the error" with "emit zero signal."

Solution:
Replace the empty catch body with a single `console.warn` (or `log.warn` if the project uses a structured logger) that includes the error message and the target path, while preserving the existing control flow so the health check still reports healthy. For example: `} catch (err) { console.warn('[budget-monitor] cache write failed (non-fatal): ' + err.message); }`. Optionally, if a metrics library is available, increment a counter such as `budget_monitor.cache_write_failures` on the same line. No rethrow, no change to the health-check return value.

Benefits:
Operators gain a greppable, alertable signal the moment the first cache write fails, turning a silent persistent degradation into a one-line log entry that can be routed to alerting. The happy path is unaffected because the branch is never entered when the write succeeds. The fix costs zero runtime overhead on the normal path and preserves the correct design decision that a transient I/O hiccup must not produce a false-positive unhealthy signal.

### AC-2 · Bare catch in budget-monitor readdir swallows non-ENOENT errors silently
Strength: Strong
Files: budget-monitor.js

Problem:
The directory-scan loop in `budget-monitor.js` wraps `fs.readdirSync(dir, { withFileTypes: true })` in a bare `catch { return out; }` with no error binding, no errno inspection, no log line, and no comment. This means that if the OS returns `EACCES` (permissions revoked mid-run), `EIO` (NFS/filesystem hiccup), or `ENOTDIR` (a config path pointing at a file), the function silently returns a shorter-than-expected entry list and the caller proceeds as though every budget record was read. In a long-running agent-manager process there is no `console.warn`, no structured log, no `process.emitWarning`, and no rethrow—so the operator has zero signal that a directory of budget entries was skipped, and the monitor will report "all clear" while actually missing records.

Solution:
Replace the bare `catch { return out; }` with a bound catch that inspects `err.code` and branches: if `err.code === 'ENOENT'`, return `out` unchanged (the directory is genuinely optional and may not exist yet during startup); for every other code (`EACCES`, `EIO`, `ENOTDIR`, etc.), emit `console.warn(\`[budget-monitor] readdirSync(${dir}) failed: ${err.code} – returning partial results (${out.length} entries)\`)` before returning `out`. Concretely, the block becomes: `let entries; try { entries = fs.readdirSync(dir, { withFileTypes: true }); } catch (err) { if (err.code === 'ENOENT') { return out; } console.warn(\`[budget-monitor] readdirSync(${dir}) failed: ${err.code} – returning partial results (${out.length} entries)\`); return out; }` followed by the existing loop over `entries`. If the project already imports a structured logger (pino, winston, bunyan), swap the `console.warn` call for `logger.warn({ dir, err: err.code, partial: out.length }, 'budget-monitor: readdirSync failed, returning partial results')` to keep the message in the same structured-log stream as the rest of the service.

Benefits:
Once the errno-aware branch is in place, the single expected case (directory not yet created) remains a silent no-op, while every unexpected failure produces a timestamped, greppable warning line that names the directory, the errno, and how many entries were actually collected. An operator tailing logs or a monitoring pipeline scraping warn-level output will immediately see that a budget directory was unreadable, can correlate the missing entries with the `EACCES`/`EIO` event, and remediate (fix permissions, restart the NFS mount, correct the path) instead of discovering the gap only when a budget line is unexpectedly absent from a report. The change is two lines of logic inside an existing catch block, introduces no new dependencies, and does not alter the function's return contract—callers still receive a (possibly partial) array—so no downstream code needs to change.

### AC-3 · Silent catch in budget-file read masks I/O and logic errors as "no entries"
Strength: Strong
Files: budget-monitor.js

Problem:
The `readFileSync` call is wrapped in a bare `catch {}` that unconditionally returns `[]` on any exception. In the budget-gating context of `budget-monitor.js`, this means a transient `EACCES`, a typo in the resolved `filePath`, a `TypeError` from an undefined path, or a partially-loaded module all produce the identical "zero budget entries" signal. The monitoring loop then treats the system as having no spend limits, and no log line, warning, metric, or error field is emitted, so the failure is invisible in dashboards, alerting, and post-incident review.

Solution:
Replace the bare `catch {}` with a `catch (err)` that inspects `err.code`. If the code is `'ENOENT'`, return `[]` (file absence is a legitimate "no entries" state). For every other error—`EACCES`, `ELOOP`, `TypeError`, `RangeError`, etc.—emit a structured `console.error` line tagged `[budget-monitor]` that includes the resolved `filePath` and the full `err.message` (plus `err.code` when present), then rethrow the error so the caller's existing error-handling path (retry, circuit-breaker, or alert) fires. If the caller cannot tolerate a throw, return a sentinel object `{ entries: [], error: err }` and update the one call-site to check for it.

Benefits:
Operators gain a single, greppable log line the moment a budget file cannot be read for any reason other than legitimate absence, turning an invisible "unbounded spend" window into an alertable event. The monitoring loop's "no entries" signal becomes trustworthy because it now only fires for the one case it was designed to represent. Future regressions—stale symlinks, permission drift after a deploy, a refactored path variable—are caught in the first monitoring tick rather than discovered weeks later in a cost report.

### AC-4 · Silent JSON-parse skip in budget-monitor leaves total data-source failure undetectable
Strength: Strong
Files: budget-monitor.js

Problem:
The per-line `try { JSON.parse(line) } catch { continue; }` block in budget-monitor.js performs no observable side-effect on failure: no counter is incremented, no warning is emitted, no metric is updated. Because this component's entire contract is to watch budget events and raise signals, a total upstream format change, an encoding corruption, or a producer emitting non-JSON lines causes every iteration to hit the catch and skip, while the monitor's event-loop tick continues and its supervisor sees a healthy process. The result is a silent, permanent zero-event state that no existing alert or dashboard can distinguish from a legitimately quiet period.

Solution:
Introduce a module-level `parseFailures` counter that is incremented inside the catch block before the `continue`. On every 1000th failure (i.e. `parseFailures % 1000 === 1`), emit a single rate-limited warning through the project's structured logger (or `console.warn` if no logger is wired yet) that includes the running failure count and a 120-character sample of the offending line for immediate context. If the project already exposes a metrics bus, also call `metrics.increment('budget_monitor.parse_failures')` on every failure so the rate is visible in dashboards and can drive a threshold alert. The `continue` itself is preserved; the fix adds observability, not a behavior change.

Benefits:
Once the counter and rate-limited log are in place, a total data-source failure becomes diagnosable within seconds: the warning line appears in logs, the metric spikes on any dashboard, and an on-call engineer can immediately distinguish "upstream broke" from "no traffic." The rate-limiting keeps log volume bounded even under a sustained flood of malformed lines, and the counter gives a precise number for post-incident review. No runtime behavior changes for well-formed lines, so the fix is non-breaking and safe to ship behind a feature flag if desired.
