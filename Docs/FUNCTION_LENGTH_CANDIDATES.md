  localCall = null, projectSearchFetch = runSearches, recordModelCall = defaultRecordModelCall,

  // Resolved here rather than as a static default param: the right backend depends on the
  // task's reasoning tier (model-provider.js's reasoningTierFor()), which isn't known
  // until the task object itself is in hand -- passing the whole task (not just
  // task.source) lets a per-instance task.reasoningTier override take effect, e.g. Brain
  // Dump #77's automatic high-reasoning retry for a needs-clarification task. Explicit
  // test/caller overrides (localCall passed in) always win -- this only fills the gap
  // production code leaves (local-draft.js's own main() calls draftTask(task) with no
  // second argument at all).
  // 2026-08-24 (model-profile-registry.js): when the task's own source declares a
  // modelProfile, its model/numCtx/numPredict become defaults for every real call below --
  // spread BEFORE each call site's own opts so a pass's own tuned numPredict (plan=1400,
  // critique=900, ...) still wins over the profile's generic default, while model/numCtx
  // (never set by any call site's own opts today) reliably take effect. Skipped entirely
  // for an injected localCall (test/caller override) -- that already wins outright, same
  // as it always has; wrapping it here would silently change what a test believes it's
  // calling.
  const modelProfile = resolveModelProfile(task);
  const profileOverrides = modelProfile
    ? { model: modelProfile.model, numCtx: modelProfile.numCtx, numPredict: modelProfile.numPredict }
    : null;
  const baseLocalCall = localCall || providerFor(task).call;
  const resolvedLocalCall = profileOverrides && !localCall
    ? (opts) => baseLocalCall({ ...profileOverrides, ...opts })
    : baseLocalCall;
```

Problem:
The async body of the local-draft entry point packs five distinct concerns into one 661-line scope: model-profile resolution and the spread-before override wrapper, backend/strategy selection among four injected draft functions keyed on task.source and reasoningTier, sequential multi-call orchestration where each pass carries its own numPredict and opts, lock acquisition and release around the entire call sequence, and per-call telemetry recording. Because all five share a single lexical scope, a developer changing the critique pass's numPredict must scroll past profile resolution, strategy branching, and lock plumbing to locate the right line. The Brain-Dump-#77 high-reasoning retry path is interleaved with the happy-path first call, so a regression in retry eligibility is 200 lines away from the call it guards. Unit tests must mock all four draft backends, the lock, and the recorder just to exercise one sub-concern in isolation, which is why the injected-dependency pattern that was clearly designed for testability is currently defeated by the monolithic scope.

Solution:
Extract four named helper functions from the body, each owning exactly one responsibility. First, resolveCallOpts(task, localCall, profileOverrides) encapsulates profile resolution, the spread-before override merge, and the "skip entirely for an injected localCall" branch, returning a plain opts object. Second, selectDraftStrategy(task, retryState) inspects task.source, task.reasoningTier, and the Brain-Dump-#77 retry flag and returns the single draft function to invoke plus its per-pass parameters (numPredict, temperature, etc.), eliminating the multi-way branch from the orchestrator. Third, executeDraftPasses(strategy, opts, localCall, withLockFn, recordModelCall) acquires the lock, runs the one or two sequential model calls (plan then critique, or the retry re-entry), records each call via recordModelCall, and releases the lock in a finally block. Fourth, the top-level function becomes a thin ~30-line composition: call resolveCallOpts, call selectDraftStrategy, call executeDraftPasses, and return the result. Each helper is independently importable and testable without the others.

Benefits:
A reviewer can approve a numPredict change by reading a 15-line opts object in resolveCallOpts instead of scanning 661 lines. The retry-eligibility logic in selectDraftStrategy becomes a pure decision function that can be table-tested with ten or twenty fixture tasks and zero mocks. The lock and telemetry in executeDraftPasses can be verified with a single fake lock and a call-recorder spy, independent of which draft backend was selected. Cognitive load drops from "understand five interlocking concerns in one scope" to "read three short, single-purpose functions in sequence," and the injected-dependency pattern finally delivers the testability it was designed for.
