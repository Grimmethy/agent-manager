# Function Length Decomposition Candidates

### AC-1 · Extract file-load and entry-lookup from applyGroupA
Strength: Strong
Files: src/apply-group-a.js
Snippet:
```

function applyBrainDumpSort({ implementResponse, task, brainDumpPath, secondBrainDir, pipelineDir }) {
  const { brainDumpEntryId, rawText } = task.promptContext;

  let data;
  try {
    data = JSON.parse(fs.existsSync(brainDumpPath) ? fs.readFileSync(brainDumpPath, 'utf8') : '{"entries":[]}');
  } catch {
    data = { entries: [] };
  }
  if (!Array.isArray(data.entries)) data.entries = [];

  const entry = data.entries.find((e) => e && e.id === brainDumpEntryId);
  if (!entry) {
    return { skipped: true, reason: `brain-dump entry "${brainDumpEntryId}" no longer exists (deleted since this task was drafted)` };
  }
  // The entry may have been edited (the dashboard's PUT resets status back to 'captured' on
  // a text change) or otherwise changed since this task was drafted -- classifying stale
  // text into the entry's CURRENT record would silently mislabel it under a rawText it no
  // longer has. Only apply if the entry is still exactly what this task was drafted against.
  if (entry.status !== 'captured' || entry.rawText !== rawText) {
    return { skipped: true, reason: 'brain-dump entry changed since this task was drafted -- not applying a stale classification' };
  }

  const result = parseBrainDumpSortResult(implementResponse);
  if (!result) {
    return { skipped: true, reason: 'implement pass did not return a valid classification -- entry left as captured for retry' };
  }
  if (!secondBrainDir) {
    return { skipped: true, reason: 'SECOND_BRAIN_DIR is not configured -- cannot file this entry anywhere' };
  }

```

Problem:
The visible opening of this 205-line function already interleaves at least two self-contained responsibilities before any domain-specific apply logic begins: a file-existence guard, a synchronous `readFileSync`, a `JSON.parse`, and a shape-coercion step on `data.entries` (a persisted-store loading concern with its own failure modes), followed immediately by an `entries.find(...)` record-retrieval concern. Neither of these is a one-liner; each carries its own error path and state assumption. Embedding them inline means a reader must track file-system state, deserialization edge cases, and array-search semantics before reaching the function's actual purpose, and any change to the store format ripples through a 205-line body rather than a single named helper.

Solution:
Extract the file-load-and-parse sequence (`fs.existsSync` guard, `readFileSync`, `JSON.parse`, and the `data.entries` shape-coercion) into a `loadBrainDump(filePath)` helper that returns a normalized store object or throws a domain-specific error. Extract the `entries.find(...)` call into a `findEntry(store, key)` helper that returns the matched entry or `undefined`. The remaining body of `applyGroupA` then starts at the point where it operates on the located entry, so the function's entry point reads as a short, legible pipeline (load → find → apply) rather than a monolithic block. Each extracted helper is small, independently callable, and has a clear contract that can be documented in its JSDoc without referencing the broader pipeline.

Benefits:
A reviewer scanning `applyGroupA` sees a three-step flow instead of a 205-line wall, making it straightforward to verify that the apply logic is correct without first mentally parsing the I/O and lookup preamble. Unit tests for `loadBrainDump` can exercise malformed JSON, missing files, and shape mismatches in isolation with no mocks beyond a temp-file fixture. Unit tests for `findEntry` can verify lookup semantics (exact key match, empty array, missing key) with a plain in-memory object. The main function's test surface shrinks to the apply logic itself, reducing the number of setup steps and mocks required per test case and making regression diffs in code review far easier to attribute to a single concern.
