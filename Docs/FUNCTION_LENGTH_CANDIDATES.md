# Function Length Decomposition Candidates

### AC-1 · Decompose `callOnce` in claude-client.js
Strength: Strong
Files: src/claude-client.js
Snippet:
```

async function callOnce({ prompt, model, effort, maxTurns = 1, allowedTools, permissionMode = 'dontAsk', cwd, timeoutMs, sandbox, resume }) {
  assertSubscriptionAuthAvailable();
  // cwd lets a caller run this against a real project directory instead of the
  // isolated scratch dir -- e.g. the dashboard's Discuss sessions (2026-08-17, brain-
  // dump entry: "Claude in the agent-manager has no access to... the system it's
  // housed inside") pass the active project's repoRoot here alongside a read-only
  // allowedTools list, so Read/Grep/Glob actually resolve real files instead of an
  // empty directory. Falls back to CLAUDE_CWD (the isolated scratch dir) for every
  // caller that doesn't explicitly ask for this -- the existing, safer default.
  const workDir = cwd || CLAUDE_CWD;
  fs.mkdirSync(workDir, { recursive: true });

  const datedPrompt = `${currentDateLine()}\n\n${prompt}`;
  const args = [
    '-p', datedPrompt,
    '--output-format', 'json',
    '--model', model || MODEL,
    '--max-turns', String(maxTurns),
    '--permission-mode', permissionMode,
  ];
  // low/medium/high/xhigh/max -- see CLI --effort. Falls back to the CLI's own default
  // (currently "high") when neither the call site nor CLAUDE_EFFORT sets one, same
  // "don't invent a value the caller didn't ask for" reasoning as `model` above.
  const effortLevel = effort || process.env.CLAUDE_EFFORT;
  if (effortLevel) args.push('--effort', effortLevel);
  // No --allowedTools by default -- this module is used as a plain text-completion
  // backend (drafting/critiquing/reviewing prompt text), the same shape as Ollama's
  // /api/generate, not an agentic session. Callers that genuinely need tool access can
  // pass allowedTools explicitly.
  //
  // But leaving tools implicitly available (the CLI's own default) combined with
```

Problem:
The 124-line `callOnce` function at line 87 interleaves at least four distinct responsibilities—environment and directory setup (auth assertion, `workDir` resolution, `mkdirSync`), CLI argument construction (conditional `--effort`, `--allowedTools`, `--permission-mode`, `--max-turns` flags), child-process lifecycle management (spawn, `timeoutMs` enforcement, `sandbox` wrapper wiring, `resume` session-id passthrough), and response parsing (extracting text and tool-use blocks from the `--output-format json` payload)—into a single linear body. The ten-parameter signature (`prompt, model, effort, maxTurns, allowedTools, permissionMode, cwd, timeoutMs, sandbox, resume`) makes it impossible for a reviewer to change timeout semantics or add a new flag without scanning the entire function for side effects on the other concerns, and the entanglement means a regression in arg-building silently corrupts the spawn call or vice versa.

Solution:
Extract three named helpers from `callOnce`, each taking only the subset of parameters it needs: (1) `resolveWorkDir(cwd, sandbox)` handles auth assertion, directory resolution, and `mkdirSync`, returning the final working directory; (2) `buildCliArgs({ model, effort, maxTurns, allowedTools, permissionMode, resume, prompt })` returns the fully-assembled `string[]` for the CLI invocation, with all conditional flag logic isolated and trivially unit-testable against a table of input objects; (3) `spawnAndCollect(workDir, args, { timeoutMs, sandbox })` encapsulates the child-process spawn, timeout timer, sandbox wrapper invocation, and stdout/stderr collection, returning a raw `{ stdout, stderr, exitCode }` object. `callOnce` then becomes a thin ~20-line orchestrator that calls those three helpers in sequence and delegates the final JSON-parsing step to a small `parseClaudeResponse(stdout)` utility, leaving the function as a readable pipeline rather than a monolith.

Benefits:
Each extracted helper is independently testable—`buildCliArgs` can be asserted against expected flag arrays without spawning anything, `spawnAndCollect` can be tested with a mock `child_process.spawn`, and `parseClaudeResponse` can be fed canned JSON fixtures—so the test surface shrinks from one brittle integration test to four fast, isolated units. Code review becomes scoped: a change to timeout behavior touches only `spawnAndCollect`, a new `--flag` touches only `buildCliArgs`, and the orchestrator diff stays under 25 lines, eliminating the "wade through 120 lines to find the one `if` I care about" cost that currently slows every PR touching this file.
