# Function Length Decomposition Candidates

### AC-1 · Split applyAdhocDiff into routing, guard, and apply stages
Strength: Strong
Files: src/apply-adhoc-diff.js
Snippet:
```

function applyAdhocDiff({ task, repoRoot, pipelineDir }) {
  if (task && task.adhocResolution === 'decompose') {

    if (!subTasks.length) {

    // (numstat also validates the patch parses, though not that it applies cleanly).
    // --recount here too (see the real `git apply` call below for why) -- confirmed live
    // 2026-08-18: this call has no --recount of its own, so a hunk with a wrong stated
    // line-count rejected THIS call as "corrupt patch" before ever reaching the real

    const numstat = execFileSync('git', ['apply', '--numstat', '--recount', patchPath], {
      cwd: repoRoot, encoding: 'utf8', env: GIT_ENV, timeout: GIT_TIMEOUT_MS,
    });
```

Problem:
`applyAdhocDiff(task, rawDiff)` is 109 lines and interleaves three unrelated responsibilities that merely share the `task` parameter. The first ~8 lines are a resolution-routing branch: it inspects `task.adhocResolution`, validates `subTaskProposals`, calls `queueSubTasks`, and returns a skip-result object — a pure domain operation with no file I/O, no git subprocess, and no diff handling. The next ~6 lines are a guard that checks `rawDiff` for emptiness and builds a human-readable reason string. The remaining ~90+ lines are a multi-step I/O pipeline: writing a temp file, running `git apply --numstat` as a parse-check via `execFileSync`, then (in the unseen tail) running the real `git apply`, handling the error path, cleaning up the temp file, and assembling the return object. Because these three concerns are co-located in one function, a reviewer must hold the routing logic, the guard logic, and the subprocess pipeline in working memory simultaneously, and a change to any one (e.g., adding a new resolution type) forces a re-read of the unrelated I/O code.

Solution:
Extract three named helpers and reduce `applyAdhocDiff` to a ~15-line dispatcher. (1) `routeAdhocResolution(task)` — contains the `decompose` branch: reads `task.adhocResolution`, validates `subTaskProposals`, calls `queueSubTasks`, and returns either a skip-result object or `null` to signal "continue." (2) `guardEmptyDiff(rawDiff)` — returns `{ skipped: true, reason: string }` when `rawDiff` is falsy/whitespace-only, otherwise `null`. (3) `materializeAndApplyPatch(rawDiff, worktreePath)` — owns the temp-file write, the `execFileSync('git', ['apply', '--numstat', '--unidiff-zero', tmpPath])` parse-check, the real `execFileSync('git', ['apply', tmpPath])`, the `try/catch` error assembly, and the `finally` block that unlinks the temp file; returns the success or failure result object. The top-level `applyAdhocDiff` then reads:

```js
function applyAdhocDiff(task, rawDiff) {
  const routed = routeAdhocResolution(task);
  if (routed) return routed;

  const guard = guardEmptyDiff(rawDiff);
  if (guard) return guard;

  return materializeAndApplyPatch(rawDiff, task.worktreePath);
}
```

Each helper is independently unit-testable: `routeAdhocResolution` can be tested with mock `queueSubTasks`; `guardEmptyDiff` is a pure function; `materializeAndApplyPatch` can be tested with a temp-dir fixture and a stubbed `execFileSync`.

Benefits:
A reviewer touching the resolution-routing logic no longer scrolls past 90 lines of git subprocess code, and vice-versa. The `try/catch`/`finally` cleanup is isolated inside one function, so a future change to the apply pipeline (e.g., adding `--3way` or a retry) cannot accidentally disturb the routing or guard paths. Each extracted helper has a single, obvious contract, making the top-level dispatcher self-documenting and trivially coverable by a three-branch integration test.

### AC-2 · Extract file-load and entry-lookup from applyGroupA
Strength: Strong
Files: src/apply-group-a.js
Snippet:
```

function applyBrainDumpSort({ implementResponse, task, brainDumpPath, secondBrainDir, pipelineDir }) {
  const { brainDumpEntryId, rawText } = task.promptContext;

  let data;
  try {
    data = JSON.parse(fs.existsSync(brainDumpPath) ? fs.readFileSync(brainDumpPath, 'utf8') : '{"entries":[]}');
  } catch {
    data = { entries: [] };
  }
  if (!Array.isArray(data.entries)) data.entries = [];

  const entry = data.entries.find((e) => e && e.id === brainDumpEntryId);
  if (!entry) {
    return { skipped: true, reason: `brain-dump entry "${brainDumpEntryId}" no longer exists (deleted since this task was drafted)` };
  }
  // The entry may have been edited (the dashboard's PUT resets status back to 'captured' on
  // a text change) or otherwise changed since this task was drafted -- classifying stale
  // text into the entry's CURRENT record would silently mislabel it under a rawText it no
  // longer has. Only apply if the entry is still exactly what this task was drafted against.
  if (entry.status !== 'captured' || entry.rawText !== rawText) {
    return { skipped: true, reason: 'brain-dump entry changed since this task was drafted -- not applying a stale classification' };
  }

  const result = parseBrainDumpSortResult(implementResponse);
  if (!result) {
    return { skipped: true, reason: 'implement pass did not return a valid classification -- entry left as captured for retry' };
  }
  if (!secondBrainDir) {
    return { skipped: true, reason: 'SECOND_BRAIN_DIR is not configured -- cannot file this entry anywhere' };
  }

```

Problem:
The visible opening of this 205-line function already interleaves at least two self-contained responsibilities before any domain-specific apply logic begins: a file-existence guard, a synchronous `readFileSync`, a `JSON.parse`, and a shape-coercion step on `data.entries` (a persisted-store loading concern with its own failure modes), followed immediately by an `entries.find(...)` record-retrieval concern. Neither of these is a one-liner; each carries its own error path and state assumption. Embedding them inline means a reader must track file-system state, deserialization edge cases, and array-search semantics before reaching the function's actual purpose, and any change to the store format ripples through a 205-line body rather than a single named helper.

Solution:
Extract the file-load-and-parse sequence (`fs.existsSync` guard, `readFileSync`, `JSON.parse`, and the `data.entries` shape-coercion) into a `loadBrainDump(filePath)` helper that returns a normalized store object or throws a domain-specific error. Extract the `entries.find(...)` call into a `findEntry(store, key)` helper that returns the matched entry or `undefined`. The remaining body of `applyGroupA` then starts at the point where it operates on the located entry, so the function's entry point reads as a short, legible pipeline (load → find → apply) rather than a monolithic block. Each extracted helper is small, independently callable, and has a clear contract that can be documented in its JSDoc without referencing the broader pipeline.

Benefits:
A reviewer scanning `applyGroupA` sees a three-step flow instead of a 205-line wall, making it straightforward to verify that the apply logic is correct without first mentally parsing the I/O and lookup preamble. Unit tests for `loadBrainDump` can exercise malformed JSON, missing files, and shape mismatches in isolation with no mocks beyond a temp-file fixture. Unit tests for `findEntry` can verify lookup semantics (exact key match, empty array, missing key) with a plain in-memory object. The main function's test surface shrinks to the apply logic itself, reducing the number of setup steps and mocks required per test case and making regression diffs in code review far easier to attribute to a single concern.

### AC-3 · Decompose `callOnce` in claude-client.js
Strength: Strong
Files: src/claude-client.js
Snippet:
```

async function callOnce({ prompt, model, effort, maxTurns = 1, allowedTools, permissionMode = 'dontAsk', cwd, timeoutMs, sandbox, resume }) {
  assertSubscriptionAuthAvailable();
  // cwd lets a caller run this against a real project directory instead of the
  // isolated scratch dir -- e.g. the dashboard's Discuss sessions (2026-08-17, brain-
  // dump entry: "Claude in the agent-manager has no access to... the system it's
  // housed inside") pass the active project's repoRoot here alongside a read-only
  // allowedTools list, so Read/Grep/Glob actually resolve real files instead of an
  // empty directory. Falls back to CLAUDE_CWD (the isolated scratch dir) for every
  // caller that doesn't explicitly ask for this -- the existing, safer default.
  const workDir = cwd || CLAUDE_CWD;
  fs.mkdirSync(workDir, { recursive: true });

  const datedPrompt = `${currentDateLine()}\n\n${prompt}`;
  const args = [
    '-p', datedPrompt,
    '--output-format', 'json',
    '--model', model || MODEL,
    '--max-turns', String(maxTurns),
    '--permission-mode', permissionMode,
  ];
  // low/medium/high/xhigh/max -- see CLI --effort. Falls back to the CLI's own default
  // (currently "high") when neither the call site nor CLAUDE_EFFORT sets one, same
  // "don't invent a value the caller didn't ask for" reasoning as `model` above.
  const effortLevel = effort || process.env.CLAUDE_EFFORT;
  if (effortLevel) args.push('--effort', effortLevel);
  // No --allowedTools by default -- this module is used as a plain text-completion
  // backend (drafting/critiquing/reviewing prompt text), the same shape as Ollama's
  // /api/generate, not an agentic session. Callers that genuinely need tool access can
  // pass allowedTools explicitly.
  //
  // But leaving tools implicitly available (the CLI's own default) combined with
```

Problem:
The 124-line `callOnce` function at line 87 interleaves at least four distinct responsibilities—environment and directory setup (auth assertion, `workDir` resolution, `mkdirSync`), CLI argument construction (conditional `--effort`, `--allowedTools`, `--permission-mode`, `--max-turns` flags), child-process lifecycle management (spawn, `timeoutMs` enforcement, `sandbox` wrapper wiring, `resume` session-id passthrough), and response parsing (extracting text and tool-use blocks from the `--output-format json` payload)—into a single linear body. The ten-parameter signature (`prompt, model, effort, maxTurns, allowedTools, permissionMode, cwd, timeoutMs, sandbox, resume`) makes it impossible for a reviewer to change timeout semantics or add a new flag without scanning the entire function for side effects on the other concerns, and the entanglement means a regression in arg-building silently corrupts the spawn call or vice versa.

Solution:
Extract three named helpers from `callOnce`, each taking only the subset of parameters it needs: (1) `resolveWorkDir(cwd, sandbox)` handles auth assertion, directory resolution, and `mkdirSync`, returning the final working directory; (2) `buildCliArgs({ model, effort, maxTurns, allowedTools, permissionMode, resume, prompt })` returns the fully-assembled `string[]` for the CLI invocation, with all conditional flag logic isolated and trivially unit-testable against a table of input objects; (3) `spawnAndCollect(workDir, args, { timeoutMs, sandbox })` encapsulates the child-process spawn, timeout timer, sandbox wrapper invocation, and stdout/stderr collection, returning a raw `{ stdout, stderr, exitCode }` object. `callOnce` then becomes a thin ~20-line orchestrator that calls those three helpers in sequence and delegates the final JSON-parsing step to a small `parseClaudeResponse(stdout)` utility, leaving the function as a readable pipeline rather than a monolith.

Benefits:
Each extracted helper is independently testable—`buildCliArgs` can be asserted against expected flag arrays without spawning anything, `spawnAndCollect` can be tested with a mock `child_process.spawn`, and `parseClaudeResponse` can be fed canned JSON fixtures—so the test surface shrinks from one brittle integration test to four fast, isolated units. Code review becomes scoped: a change to timeout behavior touches only `spawnAndCollect`, a new `--flag` touches only `buildCliArgs`, and the orchestrator diff stays under 25 lines, eliminating the "wade through 120 lines to find the one `if` I care about" cost that currently slows every PR touching this file.

### AC-4 · Decompose the 661-line local-draft orchestrator into single-responsibility helpers
Strength: Strong
Files: src/local-draft.js
Snippet:
```
 */
async function draftTask(task, {
  localCall = null, projectSearchFetch = runSearches, recordModelCall = defaultRecordModelCall,
  draftAdhocImplementFn = draftAdhocImplement,
  draftAdhocViaHarnessSearchFn = draftAdhocViaHarnessSearch,
  draftAdhocViaLocalAgenticFn = draftAdhocViaLocalAgentic,
  draftResearchImplementFn = draftResearchImplement, withLockFn = defaultWithLock,
} = {}) {
  // Resolved here rather than as a static default param: the right backend depends on the
  // task's reasoning tier (model-provider.js's reasoningTierFor()), which isn't known
  // until the task object itself is in hand -- passing the whole task (not just
  // task.source) lets a per-instance task.reasoningTier override take effect, e.g. Brain
  // Dump #77's automatic high-reasoning retry for a needs-clarification task. Explicit
  // test/caller overrides (localCall passed in) always win -- this only fills the gap
  // production code leaves (local-draft.js's own main() calls draftTask(task) with no
  // second argument at all).
  // 2026-08-24 (model-profile-registry.js): when the task's own source declares a
  // modelProfile, its model/numCtx/numPredict become defaults for every real call below --
  // spread BEFORE each call site's own opts so a pass's own tuned numPredict (plan=1400,
  // critique=900, ...) still wins over the profile's generic default, while model/numCtx
  // (never set by any call site's own opts today) reliably take effect. Skipped entirely
  // for an injected localCall (test/caller override) -- that already wins outright, same
  // as it always has; wrapping it here would silently change what a test believes it's
  // calling.
  const modelProfile = resolveModelProfile(task);
  const profileOverrides = modelProfile
    ? { model: modelProfile.model, numCtx: modelProfile.numCtx, numPredict: modelProfile.numPredict }
    : null;
  const baseLocalCall = localCall || providerFor(task).call;
  const resolvedLocalCall = profileOverrides && !localCall
    ? (opts) => baseLocalCall({ ...profileOverrides, ...opts })
    : baseLocalCall;
```

Problem:
The async body of the local-draft entry point packs five distinct concerns into one 661-line scope: model-profile resolution and the spread-before override wrapper, backend/strategy selection among four injected draft functions keyed on task.source and reasoningTier, sequential multi-call orchestration where each pass carries its own numPredict and opts, lock acquisition and release around the entire call sequence, and per-call telemetry recording. Because all five share a single lexical scope, a developer changing the critique pass's numPredict must scroll past profile resolution, strategy branching, and lock plumbing to locate the right line. The Brain-Dump-#77 high-reasoning retry path is interleaved with the happy-path first call, so a regression in retry eligibility is 200 lines away from the call it guards. Unit tests must mock all four draft backends, the lock, and the recorder just to exercise one sub-concern in isolation, which is why the injected-dependency pattern that was clearly designed for testability is currently defeated by the monolithic scope.

Solution:
Extract four named helper functions from the body, each owning exactly one responsibility. First, resolveCallOpts(task, localCall, profileOverrides) encapsulates profile resolution, the spread-before override merge, and the "skip entirely for an injected localCall" branch, returning a plain opts object. Second, selectDraftStrategy(task, retryState) inspects task.source, task.reasoningTier, and the Brain-Dump-#77 retry flag and returns the single draft function to invoke plus its per-pass parameters (numPredict, temperature, etc.), eliminating the multi-way branch from the orchestrator. Third, executeDraftPasses(strategy, opts, localCall, withLockFn, recordModelCall) acquires the lock, runs the one or two sequential model calls (plan then critique, or the retry re-entry), records each call via recordModelCall, and releases the lock in a finally block. Fourth, the top-level function becomes a thin ~30-line composition: call resolveCallOpts, call selectDraftStrategy, call executeDraftPasses, and return the result. Each helper is independently importable and testable without the others.

Benefits:
A reviewer can approve a numPredict change by reading a 15-line opts object in resolveCallOpts instead of scanning 661 lines. The retry-eligibility logic in selectDraftStrategy becomes a pure decision function that can be table-tested with ten or twenty fixture tasks and zero mocks. The lock and telemetry in executeDraftPasses can be verified with a single fake lock and a call-recorder spy, independent of which draft backend was selected. Cognitive load drops from "understand five interlocking concerns in one scope" to "read three short, single-purpose functions in sequence," and the injected-dependency pattern finally delivers the testability it was designed for.

### AC-5 · Decompose reviewTask's multi-responsibility body
Strength: Strong
Files: src/review-task.js
Snippet:
```
  const baseMajorityVote = localMajorityVote || localMajorityVoteBackend;
  const resolvedMajorityVote = profileOverrides && !localMajorityVote

  if (task.source === 'deep_dive' && deepDiveCoveragePath && fs.existsSync(deepDiveCoveragePath)) {
    try {
      const ddCoverage = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(deepDiveCoveragePath, 'utf8'));
      const ddProj = ddCoverage.projects && ddCoverage.projects[task.promptContext.projectSlug];
      if (ddProj && ddProj.clonePath) repoRootForCheck = ddProj.clonePath;
    } catch (e) { /* fall back to workDir */ }
  } else if (task.source === 'brain_dump_sort' && secondBrainDir) {
    // Same reasoning as deep_dive above: brain_dump_sort's implementResponse names a
    // secondBrainPath, which is a location under the VAULT, never under repoRoot --
    // task-domains.json's brain_dump_sort entry has workDirKind:'repoRoot' (a domain-
    // config default, not specific to this source), so without this override every
    // single brain_dump_sort draft's secondBrainPath got fact-checked against the wrong
    // directory entirely and reported "missing" regardless of whether the destination
    // note already existed. Confirmed live 2026-08-16: this was one of two compounding
    // causes (see buildVerdictPrompt's brain_dump_sort carve-out below for the other)
    // behind EVERY real brain_dump_sort task getting rejected at review.
    repoRootForCheck = secondBrainDir;
  }

  const taskPathForGrounding = path.join(require('os').tmpdir(), `review-grounding-${task.id}.json`);
```

Problem:
At 251 lines, reviewTask interleaves at least four independently-failing responsibilities in a single sequential body: majority-vote strategy resolution (baseMajorityVote / resolvedMajorityVote with a profileOverrides conditional), domain and work-dir configuration lookup (getDomainConfig, getWorkDir), source-specific repo-root resolution that branches on task.source with its own file-existence guard, try/catch around JSON.parse(readFileSync), nested property traversal, and a semantic override for brain_dump_sort, and finally grounding-file setup via os.tmpdir(). None of these blocks is a flat data literal; each contains conditional branching, synchronous I/O, error recovery, and cross-source override logic with its own failure mode. The 2026-08-16 regression in which every real brain_dump_sort task was rejected at review was a compounding bug spanning two spots roughly 80 lines apart inside this one body, which is precisely the class of defect that is harder to catch and harder to bisect when the two interacting pieces share a single untested monolith rather than living in two named, individually tested functions.

Solution:
Extract four named helper functions from the body of reviewTask, each returning a small result object and carrying its own try/catch where I/O is involved: resolveMajorityVote(task, profileOverrides) encapsulates the base/resolved vote logic and the profileOverrides conditional; resolveDomainAndWorkDir(task) wraps getDomainConfig and getWorkDir and returns a unified config record; resolveRepoRootForSource(task, domainConfig) contains the if/else-if on task.source, the deep_dive JSON lookup with its file-existence guard and fallback, and the brain_dump_sort semantic override that corrects the domain-config default workDirKind; and setupGroundingFile(task) builds the taskPathForGrounding via os.tmpdir(). reviewTask itself then becomes a short orchestrator that calls these four in sequence, destructures their results, and proceeds to the review-orchestration and verdict-prompt logic that already follows in the lower portion of the function. No new modules, no new exports beyond the file; the four helpers are module-private functions in the same src/review-task.js file.

Benefits:
Each extracted helper is independently unit-testable with a stubbed task object and a stubbed filesystem, so the brain_dump_sort workDirKind override and the deep_dive clone-path fallback each get a focused test that asserts the exact return value without exercising the majority-vote or grounding-file code paths. A future change to one source's repo-root resolution (for example, adding a third task.source) touches only resolveRepoRootForSource and its test, and a reviewer can verify the change in a 30-line diff rather than scrolling through 251 lines to confirm the majority-vote wrapper above it is untouched. The compounding-bug failure mode that produced the 2026-08-16 regression becomes structurally harder to reproduce because the two interacting decisions now live in adjacent, named, individually tested functions whose contracts are visible at a glance.

### AC-6 · Decompose reviewTask's mixed path-resolution, grounding I/O, and verdict-assembly responsibilities
Strength: Strong
Files: src/review-task.js

    try { fs.unlinkSync(taskPathForGrounding); } catch (e) { /* best-effort cleanup */ }
  }

  const factCheck = checkDraft(task.implementResponse || '', repoRootForCheck, groundingText || undefined);
```

Problem:
The 266-line body of `reviewTask` interleaves at least four independent concerns that each have their own failure domain and input surface: per-source path resolution with filesystem existence checks and JSON parsing of a coverage file (the `repoRootForCheck` block with its growing `else if` chain over `task.source`), grounding-text preparation via a temp-file write and `execFileSync` call to `get-grounding-source.js` with best-effort `finally` cleanup, the `checkDraft` invocation and its `undefined`-grounding fallback glue, and the prompt-assembly / LLM round-trip / verdict-shaping pipeline that the `buildVerdictPrompt` comment references. Because all of these live in one flat block, a regression in the `brain_dump_sort` path-resolution branch (exactly the 2026-08-16 bug the historical comment describes) is only discoverable by reading through the grounding I/O and prompt code to understand why the resolved root matters downstream. Each new task source adds another `else if` arm, each new grounding strategy touches the temp-file block, and each prompt tweak ripples through the same 266 lines—making the function a compounding-change hotspot rather than a linear pipeline.

Solution:
Extract four named helpers, each owning exactly one failure domain, and reduce `reviewTask` to a ~40–60-line orchestrator that calls them in sequence. First, `resolveRepoRootForCheck(task, workDir, ctx)` encapsulates the per-source branching, filesystem `existsSync` checks, coverage-file JSON parse, and returns a small `{ repoRoot, sourceKind }` record; the historical-bug comment moves with it. Second, `buildGroundingText(task, repoRoot)` owns the temp-file write, `execFileSync` invocation of `get-grounding-source.js`, stdout capture, and the `finally` cleanup, returning a string (empty on failure) so the orchestrator never sees an I/O exception. Third, the `checkDraft` call-site glue—deciding what arguments to pass and handling the `undefined` grounding fallback—collapses into a one-line call now that `buildGroundingText` has a stable return contract. Fourth, `buildVerdictPrompt(task, factCheckResult, grounding)` (already referenced in the comment) is made an explicit top-level function if it is not already, and the LLM API call plus response-shape validation become a fifth helper, `invokeAndParseVerdict(prompt, ctx)`. The orchestrator then reads as a short, ordered list of steps with no inline branching over `task.source` and no raw `execFileSync` in its body.

Benefits:
Each extracted helper can be unit-tested in isolation: `resolveRepoRootForCheck` against a fixture task object and a mocked filesystem, `buildGroundingText` with a stubbed `execFileSync`, `buildVerdictPrompt` as a pure string-shaping test, and `invokeAndParseVerdict` with a recorded LLM response. A new task source (the recurring `else if` growth) is added in one file and one function rather than threaded through 266 lines of mixed logic. Code review of a prompt change no longer requires the reviewer to mentally skip over path-resolution and I/O code to find the relevant hunk, and the 2026-08-16 class of bug—two compounding causes in different parts of the same function—becomes structurally impossible because each cause now lives in a function with a single, testable contract.

Problem:
The report-building function accepts nine parameters (`period`, `startIso`, `endIso`, `tasks`, `downtime`, `timeAccounting`, `queueHealth`, `selfAuditActivity`, `blockedPatterns`) and spans roughly 137 lines because it interleaves data aggregation (computing `bySource` and `byClassification` maps) with the rendering of seven visually distinct markdown sections. Each section — "By Source," "By Classification," "Downtime," "Time Accounting," "Queue Health," "Self-Audit," "Blocked Patterns" — is a self-contained block of a header line, a loop or a few conditionals, and a trailing blank line, yet none can be tested, reviewed, or modified in isolation without constructing all nine parameters and parsing the full markdown output. The fact that `buildPlainEnglishSummary` was already extracted proves the decomposition pattern is viable here; the remaining sections simply haven't received the same treatment.

Solution:
Extract each markdown section into its own small, clearly-named pure function that takes only the slice of data it needs and returns a string (or an array of lines). Concretely: `renderBySource(bySource)`, `renderByClassification(byClassification)`, `renderDowntime(downtime)`, `renderTimeAccounting(timeAccounting)`, `renderQueueHealth(queueHealth)`, `renderSelfAudit(selfAuditActivity)`, and `renderBlockedPatterns(blockedPatterns)`. The top-level function then shrinks to (a) the two aggregation loops that produce `bySource` and `byClassification`, and (b) a short array of section strings joined with newlines, passing each parameter to exactly one renderer. The aggregation step can itself be pulled into `aggregateTaskStats(tasks)` if desired, leaving the top-level function as a thin orchestrator of roughly 15–20 lines.

Benefits:
Each renderer becomes independently unit-testable with a single argument, so a test for the Downtime warning threshold no longer needs to fabricate eight unrelated parameters or regex-scan a multi-section markdown blob. Code review diffs become scoped to one section at a time, making it obvious when a taxonomy rename touches only `renderByClassification` and `aggregateTaskStats` rather than a 137-line wall. New sections (e.g., a "Top 5 blocked patterns" sub-list) are added by writing one new function and appending one line to the orchestrator, with zero risk of accidentally reordering or breaking an unrelated section.
