# Function Length Decomposition Candidates

### AC-1 · Decompose reviewTask's mixed path-resolution, grounding I/O, and verdict-assembly responsibilities
Strength: Strong
Files: src/review-task.js
Snippet:
```
  let repoRootForCheck = workDir;
  if (task.source === 'deep_dive' && deepDiveCoveragePath && fs.existsSync(deepDiveCoveragePath)) {
    try {
      const ddCoverage = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(deepDiveCoveragePath, 'utf8'));
      const ddProj = ddCoverage.projects && ddCoverage.projects[task.promptContext.projectSlug];
      if (ddProj && ddProj.clonePath) repoRootForCheck = ddProj.clonePath;
    } catch (e) { /* fall back to workDir */ }
  } else if (task.source === 'brain_dump_sort' && secondBrainDir) {
    // Same reasoning as deep_dive above: brain_dump_sort's implementResponse names a
    // secondBrainPath, which is a location under the VAULT, never under repoRoot --
    // task-domains.json's brain_dump_sort entry has workDirKind:'repoRoot' (a domain-
    // config default, not specific to this source), so without this override every
    // single brain_dump_sort draft's secondBrainPath got fact-checked against the wrong
    // directory entirely and reported "missing" regardless of whether the destination
    // note already existed. Confirmed live 2026-08-16: this was one of two compounding
    // causes (see buildVerdictPrompt's brain_dump_sort carve-out below for the other)
    // behind EVERY real brain_dump_sort task getting rejected at review.
    repoRootForCheck = secondBrainDir;
  }

  const taskPathForGrounding = path.join(require('os').tmpdir(), `review-grounding-${task.id}.json`);
  let groundingText = '';
  try {
    fs.writeFileSync(taskPathForGrounding, JSON.stringify(task));
    groundingText = execFileSync('node', [path.join(__dirname, 'get-grounding-source.js'), taskPathForGrounding], { encoding: 'utf8' });
  } catch (e) {
    groundingText = '';
  } finally {
    try { fs.unlinkSync(taskPathForGrounding); } catch (e) { /* best-effort cleanup */ }
  }

  const factCheck = checkDraft(task.implementResponse || '', repoRootForCheck, groundingText || undefined);
```

Problem:
The 266-line body of `reviewTask` interleaves at least four independent concerns that each have their own failure domain and input surface: per-source path resolution with filesystem existence checks and JSON parsing of a coverage file (the `repoRootForCheck` block with its growing `else if` chain over `task.source`), grounding-text preparation via a temp-file write and `execFileSync` call to `get-grounding-source.js` with best-effort `finally` cleanup, the `checkDraft` invocation and its `undefined`-grounding fallback glue, and the prompt-assembly / LLM round-trip / verdict-shaping pipeline that the `buildVerdictPrompt` comment references. Because all of these live in one flat block, a regression in the `brain_dump_sort` path-resolution branch (exactly the 2026-08-16 bug the historical comment describes) is only discoverable by reading through the grounding I/O and prompt code to understand why the resolved root matters downstream. Each new task source adds another `else if` arm, each new grounding strategy touches the temp-file block, and each prompt tweak ripples through the same 266 lines—making the function a compounding-change hotspot rather than a linear pipeline.

Solution:
Extract four named helpers, each owning exactly one failure domain, and reduce `reviewTask` to a ~40–60-line orchestrator that calls them in sequence. First, `resolveRepoRootForCheck(task, workDir, ctx)` encapsulates the per-source branching, filesystem `existsSync` checks, coverage-file JSON parse, and returns a small `{ repoRoot, sourceKind }` record; the historical-bug comment moves with it. Second, `buildGroundingText(task, repoRoot)` owns the temp-file write, `execFileSync` invocation of `get-grounding-source.js`, stdout capture, and the `finally` cleanup, returning a string (empty on failure) so the orchestrator never sees an I/O exception. Third, the `checkDraft` call-site glue—deciding what arguments to pass and handling the `undefined` grounding fallback—collapses into a one-line call now that `buildGroundingText` has a stable return contract. Fourth, `buildVerdictPrompt(task, factCheckResult, grounding)` (already referenced in the comment) is made an explicit top-level function if it is not already, and the LLM API call plus response-shape validation become a fifth helper, `invokeAndParseVerdict(prompt, ctx)`. The orchestrator then reads as a short, ordered list of steps with no inline branching over `task.source` and no raw `execFileSync` in its body.

Benefits:
Each extracted helper can be unit-tested in isolation: `resolveRepoRootForCheck` against a fixture task object and a mocked filesystem, `buildGroundingText` with a stubbed `execFileSync`, `buildVerdictPrompt` as a pure string-shaping test, and `invokeAndParseVerdict` with a recorded LLM response. A new task source (the recurring `else if` growth) is added in one file and one function rather than threaded through 266 lines of mixed logic. Code review of a prompt change no longer requires the reviewer to mentally skip over path-resolution and I/O code to find the relevant hunk, and the 2026-08-16 class of bug—two compounding causes in different parts of the same function—becomes structurally impossible because each cause now lives in a function with a single, testable contract.
