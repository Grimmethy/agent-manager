# Function Length Decomposition Candidates

### AC-1 · Split applyAdhocDiff into routing, guard, and apply stages
Strength: Strong
Files: src/apply-adhoc-diff.js
Snippet:
```

function applyAdhocDiff({ task, repoRoot, pipelineDir }) {
  if (task && task.adhocResolution === 'decompose') {
    const subTasks = Array.isArray(task.subTaskProposals) ? task.subTaskProposals : [];
    if (!subTasks.length) {
      return { skipped: true, reason: 'RESOLUTION: decompose but no sub-task proposals survived to apply time -- nothing queued' };
    }
    const ids = queueSubTasks(subTasks, pipelineDir, task.id);
    return { skipped: true, reason: `Decomposed into ${ids.length} sub-task(s), queued to queue/adhoc/: ${subTasks.map((t) => t.title).join('; ')}` };
  }

  const rawDiff = (task && task.rawDiff) || '';
  if (!rawDiff.trim()) {
    const reason = task && task.adhocResolution === 'no-changes-needed'
      ? `no code change needed: ${(task.implementResponse || '').slice(0, 300)}`
      : 'adhoc agentic draft produced no diff';
    return { skipped: true, reason };
  }

  const patchPath = path.join(os.tmpdir(), `adhoc-apply-${task.id}-${process.pid}.patch`);
  fs.writeFileSync(patchPath, rawDiff.endsWith('\n') ? rawDiff : `${rawDiff}\n`);
  try {
    // --numstat lists touched files without needing the patch already applied -- run
    // first so a malformed patch fails via the SAME `git apply` error path either way
    // (numstat also validates the patch parses, though not that it applies cleanly).
    // --recount here too (see the real `git apply` call below for why) -- confirmed live
    // 2026-08-18: this call has no --recount of its own, so a hunk with a wrong stated
    // line-count rejected THIS call as "corrupt patch" before ever reaching the real
    // apply below, even after --recount was added there alone.
    const numstat = execFileSync('git', ['apply', '--numstat', '--recount', patchPath], {
      cwd: repoRoot, encoding: 'utf8', env: GIT_ENV, timeout: GIT_TIMEOUT_MS,
    });
```

Problem:
`applyAdhocDiff(task, rawDiff)` is 109 lines and interleaves three unrelated responsibilities that merely share the `task` parameter. The first ~8 lines are a resolution-routing branch: it inspects `task.adhocResolution`, validates `subTaskProposals`, calls `queueSubTasks`, and returns a skip-result object — a pure domain operation with no file I/O, no git subprocess, and no diff handling. The next ~6 lines are a guard that checks `rawDiff` for emptiness and builds a human-readable reason string. The remaining ~90+ lines are a multi-step I/O pipeline: writing a temp file, running `git apply --numstat` as a parse-check via `execFileSync`, then (in the unseen tail) running the real `git apply`, handling the error path, cleaning up the temp file, and assembling the return object. Because these three concerns are co-located in one function, a reviewer must hold the routing logic, the guard logic, and the subprocess pipeline in working memory simultaneously, and a change to any one (e.g., adding a new resolution type) forces a re-read of the unrelated I/O code.

Solution:
Extract three named helpers and reduce `applyAdhocDiff` to a ~15-line dispatcher. (1) `routeAdhocResolution(task)` — contains the `decompose` branch: reads `task.adhocResolution`, validates `subTaskProposals`, calls `queueSubTasks`, and returns either a skip-result object or `null` to signal "continue." (2) `guardEmptyDiff(rawDiff)` — returns `{ skipped: true, reason: string }` when `rawDiff` is falsy/whitespace-only, otherwise `null`. (3) `materializeAndApplyPatch(rawDiff, worktreePath)` — owns the temp-file write, the `execFileSync('git', ['apply', '--numstat', '--unidiff-zero', tmpPath])` parse-check, the real `execFileSync('git', ['apply', tmpPath])`, the `try/catch` error assembly, and the `finally` block that unlinks the temp file; returns the success or failure result object. The top-level `applyAdhocDiff` then reads:

```js
function applyAdhocDiff(task, rawDiff) {
  const routed = routeAdhocResolution(task);
  if (routed) return routed;

  const guard = guardEmptyDiff(rawDiff);
  if (guard) return guard;

  return materializeAndApplyPatch(rawDiff, task.worktreePath);
}
```

Each helper is independently unit-testable: `routeAdhocResolution` can be tested with mock `queueSubTasks`; `guardEmptyDiff` is a pure function; `materializeAndApplyPatch` can be tested with a temp-dir fixture and a stubbed `execFileSync`.

Benefits:
A reviewer touching the resolution-routing logic no longer scrolls past 90 lines of git subprocess code, and vice-versa. The `try/catch`/`finally` cleanup is isolated inside one function, so a future change to the apply pipeline (e.g., adding `--3way` or a retry) cannot accidentally disturb the routing or guard paths. Each extracted helper has a single, obvious contract, making the top-level dispatcher self-documenting and trivially coverable by a three-branch integration test.
